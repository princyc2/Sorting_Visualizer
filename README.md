# Sorting_Visualizer
A sorting algorithm is a method that arranges the elements of a list in a specific order. While numerous sorting algorithms exist, practical implementations often focus on a 
select few. This sorting visualizer implementation explores several commonly used algorithms, including Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Quick Sort, and Heap Sort. The list size is set at 130 elements, and users can randomize the list, selecting from various sorting algorithms to observe their visual representation. It's important to note that the visualized sorting time may not precisely reflect the actual time complexities of the algorithms. To enhance visualization, faster algorithms like Merge Sort have been intentionally slowed down for better comprehension. All algorithms in this context aim to sort the elements in ascending order.
